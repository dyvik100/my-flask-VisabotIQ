FAQ
Can Someone Else Submit My Documents on My Behalf?
It’s mandatory you submit your documents on the day of your Schengen visa appointment by yourself since you have to submit your biometric data. But, in case of an emergency, you cannot physically visit the embassy or visa centre; you may authorise someone else to apply on your behalf— provided you’ve already given your fingerprints for a previous Schengen visa application. In that case, you need to prepare a written authorisation signed by you or give power of attorney so that person is officially allowed to submit the documents for you. Please note that you may be required to notarise your visa application.
Do I Need to Submit Original Documents?
Most Schengen embassies require original copies of documents. For your passport, you must submit the original travel document along with a photocopy, while some embassies may also ask for certified copies of other documents (marriage certificate, family certificate, etc.).
Do I Need to Submit My Biometrics?
Yes, you must submit your fingerprints at the embassy/consulate/visa centre on the day of your visa interview. Ten digital fingerprints will be required (if applicable) and stored in VIS (Schengen Visa Information System). However, you must submit your biometrics only if this is your first visa application or if five years have passed since you last submitted your fingerprints.
Note: Children under 12 do not need to submit their biometric information.
Can I Staple My Documents?
If the embassy or consulate where you apply for your Schengen visa does not specifically mention stapling your documents, please do not do so. You can use paper clips to separate or attach any additional documents, but do not staple or glue them unless specifically requested.
How Do I Organize My Schengen Visa Documents?
There is no set way how to organise your documents for your Schengen visa — all embassies have different requests. Some may ask you to arrange your documents starting from your application form and followed by your passport, while the rest are in no particular order. But, some other embassies may ask you to put your passport and identity photos first, followed by the application form. If there are no particular instructions from your application centre or embassy, make sure you have all the required documents and arrange them in a logical manner.
Do I Need to Translate My Documents?
If you have a document issued in your native language, for example, your work contract or your medical certificate it must be in English or in one of the corresponding languages of the Schengen country. Any translated documents must be legalised or certified with an Apostille stamp to be valid for submission.
Will My Schengen Visa Be Denied if I Forget One Document?
If you forget important documents such as a travel insurance certificate, or photo identity, your visa may be rejected immediately. However, some embassies and visa centres may ask you to submit your application again with the complete documentation without denying your visa— this depends on the embassy and the document you forgot.
Will the Embassy Return My Documents if My Schengen Visa Application Is Rejected?
Some embassies will return your passport along with the other documents you submitted in case your Schengen visa application is denied. Other embassies may only return your passport but not the rest of the documents. Either way, if you want to re-apply for a Schengen visa, you need to assemble the needed documents from the beginning, as those documents you already submitted will no longer be valid (e.g., your bank statements, travel insurance certificate, etc.).
Do I Need to Submit My Biometrics Again if My Schengen Visa Is Denied?
Generally, you must submit your fingerprints again if your initial visa application is denied and you’re applying for a new visa. This means you must visit the visa centre or embassy to submit your biometric data.
